# WebGL_GPGPU-Water-Simulation

Heightmap water simulation using WebGL and GPGPU. Based Navier-Stokes ecuations. The integration methods used are Euler, Basic Verlet and Velocity Verlet.
Project that consists in the study of different integration methods for water simulation and behavior in simulation.
Presented as final degree work at the UPV/EHU.
